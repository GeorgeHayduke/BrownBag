**George Washington Hayduke** is a fictional character in Edward Abbey's novels __The Monkey Wrench Gang__ and __Hayduke Lives!__

Hayduke is an ex-Green Beret, one-time explosives expert and medic in the Vietnam War; and an American environmentalist hero. The specific cultural use of the term Hayduke is derived from this character.

The character of Hayduke was based on Edward Abby's friend and author, Doug Peacock, a Vietnam vet that Abbey befriended and traveled with in the Southwest United States. He is most likely named after the Haiduks, rebels in the Ottoman Empire, and one of Eric Hobsbawm's archetypal bandits.
